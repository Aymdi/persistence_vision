# Persistence Vision

The goal of this project is to program a persistence of vision display. A 16 leds strip is assembled on a board itself assembled on a rotating motor. By changing the leds configuration while it's moving, it is then possible to display things. More details in this [link](https://gregwar.com/se/project.html).
